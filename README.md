# Terra Resource Buffering Server
Cloud resource buffering server for Terra. 

# Deployment
## Run Locally
Set executable permissions:
```
chmod +x gradlew
```

To spin up the local postgres, run:
```
local-dev/run_postgres.sh start
```
Start local server
```
local-dev/run_local.sh
```

## Deploy to GKE cluster:
The provided setup script clones the terra-helm and terra-helmfile git repos,
and templates in the desired Terra environment/k8s namespace to target.
If you need to pull changes to either terra-helm or terra-helmfile, rerun this script.

To use this, first ensure Skaffold is installed on your local machine 
(available at https://skaffold.dev/). 

> Older versions of Skaffold (v1.4.0 and earlier) do not have support for Helm 3 and will fail to deploy your 
changes. If you're seeing errors like `UPGRADE FAILED: "(Release name)" has no 
deployed releases`, try updating Skaffold.

You may need to use gcloud to provide GCR
 credentials with `gcloud auth configure-docker`. Finally, run local-run.sh with
  your target environment as the first argument:

```
cd local/dev
```
```
./setup_gke_deploy.sh <environment>
```

You can now push to the specified environment by running

```
skaffold run
```
